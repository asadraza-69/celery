Celery 4.0+ does not officially support window already. 
But it still works on window for some development/test purpose.
Use eventlet instead as below:

redis command to run on command
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379


pip install eventlet
celery -A <project_name> worker -l info -P eventlet
celery -A testing worker -l info -P eventlet #main running command


celery -A celery_worker.celery worker --loglevel=INFO 
celery -A celery_worker.celery flower --port=5555
celery -A project_name.
